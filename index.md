  Hey everyone, I'm Yaro! I live in Austin, TX, and I'm the founder of Veritas, an AI prospecting platform for financial advisors designed to supercharge growth. In 2021, I transitioned from engineering to quant finance, driven by a strong passion for building algorithms, stochasting modeling and AI applications. I hold an MEng in Aerospace and Aeronautics from Imperial College London and an MSc in Financial Mathematics from the University of Chicago. Until May 2024, I worked at Dimensional Fund Advisors on the strategy research desk before deciding to start my own venture.

  Currently, my main focus is on my startup, but I'm also very curious about Computer Science, LLM architectures, Constrained and Parallel Optimization, and Quantitative Finance. When I'm not learning or reading, I enjoy actively investing in the stock and options markets and exploring development property outside of the US. I also hope to start a blog to share my knowledge with other passionate investors and enthusiasts.

  I'm looking forward to connecting with everyone!
