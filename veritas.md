  - title: "[February 2024] The Original Idea - Financial Advisor LLM for Retail Investors"

    description: <p>At a very early stage of Veritas (back then Pulse), I concluded that general-purpose LLMs were not great at answering domain-specific questions and accessing niche information online. In my view, the future lay in fine-tuning/retraining on data from specific tasks, rather than on scraped data from all over the Internet.</p> <p>Since I was mainly interested in Quant Finance, I started testing open-source models to see how they'd answer questions on portfolio allocation, stochastic modeling, finance/economic theories, trading considerations, and more. As expected, the results were too generic and lacked good references. My initial idea was to build an AI financial advisor by simply taking an open-source LLM and fine-tuning it using relevant websites, books, forums, and articles.</p> <p>I started by using Alpaca LoRA 4-bit and quickly noticed some performance issues and hallucinations when using the 7B model. Using LoRA outside of Alpaca seemed like a lot of friction back then. Alpaca was not as good as GPT-4 or Mistral's large model. I met someone who recommended using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with AnythingLLM to quickly eliminate any product risk. AnythingLLM is a nice UI where a user can emulate a domain-specific database by uploading PDFs, text files, etc., which the model of your choice will refer to in the answers.</p> <p>Now that the product risk had been removed, the billion-dollar question was if there was a market for it...</p>

    description: <p>The idea to apply to YC came to me around January - February 2024, and luckily, I had plenty of time to prepare before the deadline. Knowing the challenges of startups, my first priority was to find the right cofounder. Despite tapping into my network, changing cities frequently meant I didn't know many technical people in Austin.</p> <p>While long-distance collaboration can work, I felt that in-person interactions were crucial for a startup's success. Many of my friends faced legal constraints due to visas and permits, and those without such issues were hesitant to join a venture without proven market fit.</p> <p>I didn't give up and registered on the YC co-founder matching platform, starting to "date" potential co-founders here in Austin. Soon after, I found a solid CTO, and we began working together. We brainstormed different ideas, read case studies, shared insights into LLMs, focusing on finding an "acute and frequent" problem.</p> <p>Among many case studies, I remember reading about <a href="https://www.news.aakashg.com/p/rocket-plus-truebill">Truebill's story</a>, thinking that their idea was genius and simple—cancel useless subscriptions and/or negotiate new rates. I got super inspired by this and immediately suggested we build Truebill for financial products. Asset managers charge investors a monthly "subscription" for investing in their product, also known as a management fee. The idea was to look into your portfolio (multiple investment accounts), analyze how much you're paying for an ETF/Mutual Fund, and recommend the most similar product at a lower cost.</p> <p>Our prototype collected your investment data through Excel/Plaid and provided an actionable report showing if you're overpaying for a given category. Think of the S&P 500 index; the most liquid S&P 500 ETF is SPY, which charges you 0.09%. There is an alternative four times cheaper—SPLG, a tracking index ETF by State Street that charges 0.02%. Both ETFs perform the exact same function, and even though SPLG is less liquid, it shouldn't matter if you're investing long-term. Thus, there is a clear, cost-effective solution to your problem.</p> <p>A few weeks before the application deadline, I realized that the partnership with the CTO was not working out, so I decided to build the prototype myself and apply solo. I quickly developed an MVP in three weeks and even added a custom-made chatbot to follow up on the recommendations. The pipeline was &quot;share your holdings -&gt; get a report showing how much you can save -&gt; follow up on the recommendations with an AI chatbot.&quot; The demo worked well, and <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmulLoHprgk">I recorded a 3-minute video for YC</a> and sent my application. </p>

  - title: "[February 2024] The First Pivot"

    description: <p>Immediately after I applied to YC, I started talking to customers (should've done it the other way around). I desperately wanted to validate the market for what I believed was an acute problem. Who doesn’t want to cut costs in their portfolios?</p><p>Following Steve Blank’s approach, my initial hypothesis was that DIY investors with high savings rates often don't know if they are investing in the cheapest and best-performing products for their strategy. This could be due to Google SEO, lack of time to research each fund, inability to receive financial advice, and too much friction on fund comparison websites. I also tested my market on account aggregation, assuming investors struggle to manage multiple accounts separately. Thus, the customer discovery began.</p><p>Initially, I spoke with people I knew well and paid little attention to segmenting my audience—a mistake. In the first week, I had 40 conversations with a "diverse" group -  DIY investors, those not investing in the market, employees with compliance restrictions, people near retirement, and those outsourcing their financial journey to a CFP/FA. My interview notebook became a mess with conflicting opinions, making it hard to find a clear signal.</p><p>The interview process was too formal as I followed Steve Blank’s book. After reading The Mom Test, I made the conversations more casual. A formal interview setup made customers feel too rigid and uncomfortable. I developed a better interview structure by looking for anchors, pain points, asking open-ended questions, and seeking specific past examples. I stopped wasting time on people who opened with “I don’t invest in the market.” It was hard for my ego to accept that not everyone needed my service, but I learned to focus on those who did. I began ending meetups quickly if it was clear the person didn’t have the problem I was addressing.</p><p>After the first week, I came across a YC video and decided to segment the market more precisely since I wasn’t making progress. Every conversation felt lukewarm. PMF should feel like stepping on a landmine. “Find the customer with their hair on fire and offer them a brick to put it out.”</p><p>I identified that 35-45-year-old FIRE DIY investors from tech would likely be interested. Since I didn't know anyone in this category, I started connecting with people on LinkedIn, using InMails and short intros to secure video chats on Zoom. My conversion ratio was less than 0.5%, which felt disheartening. Out of 400 messages, only two people talked to me, one of whom wanted to be a cofounder. That didn’t feel right, so I started DMing relevant people from subreddits. I created an AI chatbot to scrape subreddits, verify users, and check for real issues with management fees and aggregation. Out of 300 messages and 60+ textual conversations, only one person hopped on a call. I had good chats with people on Reddit but heavily discounted those datapoints as per The Mom Test. People don’t want to give up their anonymity on Reddit, which I misjudged.</p><p>I decided to stop after 50 conversations. Seeing no traction and having spent two weeks glued to my laptop, I decided to pivot. Here are the main reasons why.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Investors have witnessed one of the greatest bull markets of all time.</li><li>Investors don’t care about small costs hidden in fund performance.</li><li>DIY investors believe their portfolios are already optimal.</li>
    </ul>

Veritas is a startup I began working on full-time in May '24. The philosophy behind the startup is influenced by three books: The Four Steps to the Epiphany by Steve Blank, The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, and The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick.
</p>

<p>
As of June '24, I have pivoted twice from the original idea due to a lack of product-market fit. With each new pivot, I strive to follow a lean approach—validating the idea first and gaining traction without committing months to a product that no one will end up paying for.</p> <p>In this section, I want to share my startup milestones, mistakes I've made, and the ideas behind each iteration, pivot, product, and customer segment.
