Veritas is a startup I began working on full-time in May '24. The philosophy behind the startup is influenced by three books: The Four Steps to the Epiphany by Steve Blank, The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, and The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick. As of June '24, I have pivoted twice from the original idea due to a lack of product-market fit. With each new pivot, I strive to follow a lean approachâ€”validating the idea first and gaining traction without committing months to a product that no one will end up paying for. In this section, I want to share my startup milestones, mistakes I've made, and the ideas behind each iteration, pivot, product, and customer segment.
