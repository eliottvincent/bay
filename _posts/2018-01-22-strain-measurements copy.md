This is my earliest work from 2018[^1], focusing on using electric strain gauges to analyze the strain and stress characteristics of various materials. Strain gauges are also commonly used for long-term structural monitoring, such as placing sensors on bridges to detect weak points where excessive stress and vibrations might lead to failure.
