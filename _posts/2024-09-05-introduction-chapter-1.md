In these notes, I dive into the basics of reinforcement learning (RL) and how it's all about learning through interaction with the environment to achieve goals by maximizing cumulative rewards. RL aligns with the idea of intelligence, as it's essentially about making smart decisions based on feedback. I explore key concepts like value functions and policies, which help the agent decide the best actions for long-term rewards. I also learned that the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is crucial for modeling these decisions. RL can be either model-free or model-based, depending on whether an agent learns directly from interaction or uses a model to plan. Overall, RL feels like a powerful framework for navigating complex, unknown environments.
