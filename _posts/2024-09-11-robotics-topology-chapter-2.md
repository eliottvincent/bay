These study notes cover concepts from Chapter 2 of Modern Robotics by Lynch and Park, focusing on topology and configuration spaces (C-space) in robotics. I explored the importance of both dimension and shape in defining a robotâ€™s C-space, with a detailed discussion on implicit versus explicit parametrization. Additionally, I reviewed the nature of holonomic and nonholonomic constraints and how they affect robot motion, with specific examples like rolling without slipping. I also examined task space and workspace, explaining how they differ, particularly in relation to end-effector positioning and joint limitations. Lastly, the exercises helped solidify my understanding of the mathematical descriptions of C-spaces.
