My final year thesis from 2021[^1] explored alternative tools for analyzing turbulent flow. Before 2019-2020, academia primarily relied on numerical, statistical, and deterministic methods to model turbulent flows. Numerical solutions often demand significant computational resources, especially for complex geometries. Statistical methods, such as Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, are limited to relatively simple geometries. Deterministic approaches tend to oversimplify flows, neglecting factors like viscosity and compressibility. We proposed a novel approach using autoencoding feed-forward neural networks to analyze coherent structures in turbulent flows.
